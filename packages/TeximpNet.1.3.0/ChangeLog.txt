CHANGELOG
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3 (4/1/2018)

	- Added DDS File read/write support (DDSFile / DDSContainer).
	- Removed CompressedImageData in favor of DDSContainer / MipData (consolidated the APIs)
	- Updated to C# 7.2 compiler (generated assemblies are backwards compatible)
	- Minor changes to some helpers:
		- Moved a bunch of image-related routines out of MemoryHelper into a new static class called ImageHelper, these are mostly used internally but are public APIs
			and thus a breaking change.
		- Synced MemoryHelper to current up-to-date C# 7.2 implementation from Tesla 3D Engine. Mostly should have added functions and updated the internals of a few.
		- Added StreamTransferBuffer, a wrapper around a temporary byte buffer that can interop with unmanaged memory, copied from Tesla 3D Engine. Used internally, but is
			still a public API

Targets:

FreeImage 3.17.0
Nvidia Texture Tools 2.1.1




======================================================================




1.2 (2/14/2018)

	- Now available on .NET Core!! (.NET Standard 1.3 target). Nuget package also supports .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.x targets.
	- Shipping Linux binaries (x64 only) for NVVT and FreeImage (tested on Ubuntu 17.10)
	- Default native library names are handled slightly differently now. The default name is w/o an extension, and each platform initializer will append a prefix/extension
	- Unmanaged library loading is now thread safe
	- Simplified Compressor SetData/SetMipmapData API, they also properly handle input images that are padded
	- Can set 3D image to compressor, 2D array (non-cube) are possible, but the C-API doesn't expose setting an array count yet...
	- Added some more formats to convert FreeImage surfaces to
	- Added a Surface.LoadFromRawData method to load from a 32-bit BGRA/RGBA image
	- Added queries for bitmap palettes

Targets:

FreeImage 3.17.0
Nvidia Texture Tools 2.1.1
