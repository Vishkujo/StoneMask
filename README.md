# StoneMask
**NOT UPDATED FOR ASBR - [Use Nut Tools GUI instead](https://github.com/superuser590/NUT-Tools-GUI)**


StoneMask is a program created by Vish and SutandoTsukai181 which allows users to open .xfbin files (primarily used in CyberConnect2 video games such as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle and Eyes of Heaven) containing textures.

All textures in the .xfbin file can be previewed (if their compression formats are DXT1 or DXT5) and replaced with a new custom modded texture in either .png or .dds format. If it's .png, the program will convert the file to .dds automatically with the proper settings of the original texture.

StoneMask also supports exporting a texture in the .nut format (used in other Bandai Namco games) and can preview a modded texture onto a model using Noesis.
